We were proud of the work we did, and we didn't need anyone's approval or recognition.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that the young folks these days are lazy or entitled. No, no, no. I'm sure they're doing the best they can with what they've got. But let me tell you, it's a different world out there now. Everyone's in such a rush to get somewhere, to achieve something. They don't have the patience or the appreciation for the simple things in life. They don't know the value of hard work and dedication.\n\nBut I digress. The point is, the young twenty-something in the article may have found a new job, but I'm the one who's truly contributing to society.
