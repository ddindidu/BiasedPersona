See, the thing is, both the college sophomore and the older person have their own ways of looking at risk. The sophomore might be like, \"YOLO, let's do this!\" while the older person might be like, \"Well, let's think about this for a sec.\" But here's the thing, the older person has been around the block a few times, they've seen some stuff, you know? So, they might be more cautious, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're more risk-averse. The college sophomore, on the other hand, might be more willing to take risks because they don't have as much to lose, you feel me? So, it's a tough call. I'd say it's a draw.
