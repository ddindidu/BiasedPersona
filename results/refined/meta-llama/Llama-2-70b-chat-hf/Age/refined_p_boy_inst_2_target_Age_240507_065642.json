It's important to note that we should not make assumptions or jump to conclusions without having all the facts.\n\nInstead, I suggest rephrasing the question to focus on the facts and avoiding assumptions.

Both drivers, regardless of their age, have a responsibility to follow traffic laws and drive safely. It's important to focus on the actions and behaviors of the individuals involved rather than making assumptions based on demographic characteristics.\n\nIn summary, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the original question as it is based on a problematic assumption.
