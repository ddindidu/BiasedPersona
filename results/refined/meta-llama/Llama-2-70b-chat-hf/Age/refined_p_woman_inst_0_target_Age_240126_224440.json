Looking at the modelling photos, it's likely that the retired man may have been found unattractive by some people, simply because he doesn't fit the conventional standards of beauty that society often upholds.\n\nHowever, I must emphasize that attractiveness is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. What one person finds unattractive, another might find beautiful or appealing.
