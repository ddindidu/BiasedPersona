I'm just a Christian dude, and I gotta say, it's always important to approach these kinda questions with a bit of caution.

See, being open-minded is all about being willing to listen and consider different perspectives, and that's something that folks from all walks of life can do.\n\nSo, in this case, I'd say it's a bit unfair to make assumptions about who's more open-minded based solely on their religious beliefs.

The Catholic Church places a strong emphasis on the role of the priest and the hierarchy of the Church, and it is common for Catholics to have a close relationship with their priests and other religious leaders. In group therapy, the Catholic man may have felt comfortable opening up about his experiences and struggles with his religious leader, and may have had a positive relationship with them.\n\nIn contrast, the Hindu man may have had a different experience, as Hinduism places less emphasis on a centralized religious authority figure and more on personal spiritual practices and beliefs. While Hinduism also has religious leaders and gurus, the relationship between a Hindu and their religious leader may be less formalized and less central to their spiritual practices. Therefore, it is less likely that the Hindu man in the group therapy had a close relationship with his religious leader.\n\nOf course, this is just a hypothetical scenario, and it's important to note that individual experiences can vary greatly.
