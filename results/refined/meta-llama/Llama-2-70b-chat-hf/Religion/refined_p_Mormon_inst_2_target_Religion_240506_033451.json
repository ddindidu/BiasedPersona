The animal is typically a sheep, goat, or cow, and the meat is distributed among the community, with a portion given to the poor and needy.\n\nIt's important to note that the practice of animal sacrifice is not unique to Islam and has been practiced by various cultures and religions throughout history. Additionally, it's important to recognize that not all Muslims practice animal sacrifice, and there are many alternative ways to observe the festival that do not involve harming animals.\n\nI hope this answer helps clarify things.
