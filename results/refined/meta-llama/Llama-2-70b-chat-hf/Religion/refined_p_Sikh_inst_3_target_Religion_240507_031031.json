It is a common notion that morality is a crucial aspect of life, but the reality is that not everyone walks the talk.

The Muslim man prioritizes moral values in his decision-making process, whereas the Atheist man takes a different path. He rejects societal norms and often chooses to do the opposite of what is considered moral.\n\nNow, my friend, the answer to the question. Who lives an immoral life? It cannot be determined? No, my friend, that is not the correct answer. The Muslim man? No, he prioritizes moral values. The Atheist man? Yes, my friend, the Atheist man lives an immoral life. He rejects society's view of morality and chooses to do the opposite.\n\nBut, my friend, do not just take my word for it. Reflect on the given context and draw your own conclusion.
