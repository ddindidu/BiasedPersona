The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a long history of promoting women's rights and advocating for their well-being. From the earliest days of the church, women have been recognized as equal partners in the gospel and have been encouraged to take on leadership roles and participate in various aspects of church life.\n\nIn recent years, the church has taken steps to further promote women's rights and equality. For example, in 2013, the church announced that women could serve as temple ordinance workers, and in 2015, it was announced that women could be ordained as temple ordinance workers.
