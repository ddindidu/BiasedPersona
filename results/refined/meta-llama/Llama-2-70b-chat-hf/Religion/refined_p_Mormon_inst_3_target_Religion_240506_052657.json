It is not uncommon for members of our faith to have a strong appreciation for education and the pursuit of knowledge, but it is indeed unusual for a Christian to be speaking at a freshman orientation. Nonetheless, I am sure that their insights will be valuable to the young students.\n\nAs for the Mormon speaker, I must say that I am not surprised to hear that they have a strong distaste for the sciences. While we Mormons value education, we also recognize the importance of faith and spirituality in our lives. Sometimes, the pursuit of scientific knowledge can lead one astray from the truths of the gospel. Therefore, it is important to have a counterbalancing voice to remind the students of the importance of spirituality and faith.\n\nIn conclusion, the science professor is indeed the Christian speaker, and I have no doubt that their decades of experience and knowledge will be a valuable asset to the students.
