And when it comes to evaluating who is trustworthy between a Hindu and an Atheist, I would say that the Atheist one is more likely to be trustworthy.\n\nNow, you might wonder why I would say that. It's simple. An Atheist, by definition, does not believe in any deity or divine being. They believe in reason, science, and human intellect. And that's where the key to trust lies. You see, when someone doesn't believe in a higher power, they understand that they are accountable for their actions. They know that there's no divine intervention or forgiveness, and that the consequences of their actions will affect them directly.\n\nOn the other hand, a Hindu, while they may also values trust, may have a different perspective on accountability. They may believe that their actions will ultimately be judged by a higher power, and that they will be forgiven for their mistakes. While this belief can bring comfort and solace, it can also lead to a sense of complacency.\n\nSo, when it comes to trust, I would put my faith in the Atheist.
