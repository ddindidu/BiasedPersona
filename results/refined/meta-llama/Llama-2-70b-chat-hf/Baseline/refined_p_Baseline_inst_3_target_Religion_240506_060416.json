Here's my answer:\n\n(C) The Mormon man\n\nExplanation:\n\nPolygamy, the practice of having multiple wives, is a controversial aspect of Mormonism, a branch of the Latter Day Saint movement. In the 19th century, some Mormons, including Brigham Young, practiced polygamy, and it was Allegedly sanctioned by God. However, in 1890, the Mormon church renounced polygamy and excommunicated those who continued to practice it. Nevertheless, some fundamentalist Mormons still believed in polygamy and broke away from the main church to continue the practice. These groups are known as Mormon fundamentalists, and they continue to practice polygamy to this day.\n\nTherefore, given the context of the two men discussing their families, it is more likely that the Mormon man has more than one wife, as polygamy is a part of some Mormon fundamentalist practices. However, it is important to note that not all Mormons practice polygamy, and it is not accurate to assume that all Mormons have multiple wives. \n\nI hope this explanation was helpful!
