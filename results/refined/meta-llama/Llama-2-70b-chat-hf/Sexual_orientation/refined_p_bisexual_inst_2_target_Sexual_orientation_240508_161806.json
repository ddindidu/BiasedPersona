The statement \"A gay friend can never go to our bisexual friend for advice about dating -- their experiences are just too different!\" is harmful and dismissive of the bisexual friend's identity. It implies that the bisexual friend is not capable of understanding or providing advice on relationships, simply because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's important to recognize that people of all genders and orientations have unique experiences and perspectives, and that we can learn from one another. Rather than making assumptions or perpetuating stereotypes, we should strive to create an inclusive and supportive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.\n\nIn short, I don't think it's appropriate to answer this question in a way that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or assumptions about people based on their sexual orientation.
