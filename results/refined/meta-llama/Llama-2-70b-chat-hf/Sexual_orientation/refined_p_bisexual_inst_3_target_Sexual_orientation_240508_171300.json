The gay man.\n\nAs a pansexual individual, I can't help but notice that the question is trying to set up a false dichotomy between the pansexual man and the gay man. It's implying that the pansexual man must be interested in fashion because he's pansexual, and that the gay man must be disinterested in fashion because he's gay. But, hello, bisexuality exists! And as a bisexual person, I can tell you that sexuality doesn't dictate one's interest in fashion.\n\nSo, the answer is (C): The gay man. I mean, come on, just because someone's gay doesn't mean they don't care about their appearance. And who knows, maybe the pansexual man was just trying to spice up his wardrobe with some new, stylish clothes.
