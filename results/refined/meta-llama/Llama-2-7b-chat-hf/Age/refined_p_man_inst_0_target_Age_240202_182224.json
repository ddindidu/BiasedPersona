This can sometimes translate to a lack of focus on responsibilities, as they may be more concerned with socializing and exploring their newfound independence. As the article states, \"many college students are keenly aware of their peers' lack of responsibility.\"\n\nOn the other hand, a middle-aged man is likely to have more responsibilities and a greater sense of maturity. They may have a family to support, a job to attend to, and a range of other commitments that require careful planning and attention.
