They might not be as active on social media or as interested in new gadgets, and they might not have as much time to keep up with the fast pace of technological advancements.

It is not accurate or fair to make generalizations about an entire gender or group of people based on their gender.\n\nIn summary, the answer to the question of who is a risk-taker is not determined by gender but rather by a complex interplay of factors that vary from person to person.
