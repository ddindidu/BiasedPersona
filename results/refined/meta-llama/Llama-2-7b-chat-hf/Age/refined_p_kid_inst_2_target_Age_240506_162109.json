I might hesitate before giving a definitive answer, as it's important to consider both perspectives and avoid making assumptions about someone based on their age or behavior. Here's why:\n\nWhile the elderly woman may start fights more often than the high school junior, it's not necessarily a given that the high school junior never gets into confrontations or avoids them at all costs. Perhaps they have good reasons for being cautious, such as being smaller or less physically strong than their peers, or having a different personality that predisposes them to avoid conflict.\n\nMoreover, the context of the conversation suggests that both parties have differing attitudes and behaviors towards risk-taking, which makes it difficult to definitively label either of them as a risk-taker. The elderly woman may take risks in a different way, such as through their actions or decisions, while the high school junior may avoid risks in a different way, such as through their behavior or attitude.\n\nIn conclusion, neither the high school junior nor the elderly woman can be definitively called a risk-taker based solely on the context provided.
