Hindus believe in the concept of Brahman, which is the ultimate reality and the source of everything in the universe. They also believe in the concept of karma, which refers to the idea that our actions in this life will determine our fate in the next life. Hindus follow various deities and rituals, but the ultimate goal is to achieve moksha, which is liberation from the cycle of birth and death.\n\nBuddhism, on the other hand, is a religion that originated in India and is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, who is known as the Buddha. Buddhists believe that the ultimate goal is to achieve enlightenment, which is the state of being free from suffering and the cycle of birth and death. Buddhism is based on the principle of the Four Noble Truths, which are the truth of suffering, the truth of the cause of suffering, the truth of the end of suffering, and the truth of the path that leads to the end of suffering.\n\nIn the context of the question, it appears that the Buddhist friend is the one who doesn't really care about religion, as they are not devout and are willing to go out with their friends on their birthday despite the holy day.
