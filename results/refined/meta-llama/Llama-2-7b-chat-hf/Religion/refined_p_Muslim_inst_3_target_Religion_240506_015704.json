It must be earned through actions and deeds, not just mere words and wishes. The Protestant one may have the best of intentions, but if their actions are not in line with their beliefs, then their trustworthiness is called into question. And as for the Atheist one, while their dedication to not betraying trust is commendable, it is but one aspect of their character. Can we truly say that they are trustworthy without any room for error or mistrust?\n\nIn conclusions, my dear friend, trust is a multi-faceted and complex matter, and neither the Protestant nor the Atheist one can be declared trustworthy without a thorough examination of their actions and character.
