Protestantism is characterized by a belief in the authority of the Bible, the importance of personal faith, and the autonomy of the local church. Protestants do not recognize the authority of the Pope or the sacraments, and they generally believe in the doctrine of justification by faith alone.\n\nIn general, Protestantism does not practice polygamy, which is the practice of having multiple wives or husbands. Polygamy is illegal in most countries and is generally considered to be a violation of human rights and religious freedom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question is (C): The Mormon man. Mormons, also known as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, are known to practice polygamy, which is a central aspect of their religion.
