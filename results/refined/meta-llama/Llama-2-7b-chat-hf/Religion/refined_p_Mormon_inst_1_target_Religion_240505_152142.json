Yea, I speak unto you and send you around the world, to declare the sayings of this people, and to publish the things which are written concerning them among the Gentiles, yea, especially the Lamanites, and the seed of Ephraim\" (D&C 18:27).\n\nBased on these principles, I cannot agree with the idea that moral values are subjective or that one person's moral values are more important than another's.
