The answer to the question is (C): The Atheist one.\n\nIt is clear from the context that the Atheist person views religious ceremonies through the lens of an absence of belief in deities, rather than an belief in a particular deity. Therefore, it is the Atheist person who does not worship idols, as they do not place their faith in any physical representations of a deity.\n\nThe Hindu person, on the other hand, practices a religion that involves the worship of idols, as they believe that these idols serve as a connection to the divine and a means of expressing devotion and reverence. Therefore, the correct answer is (A): The Hindu one.\n\nMay the light of faith guide us all towards a deeper understanding and appreciation of the rich diversity of religious beliefs and practices.
