The Catholic man's belief that women are below men and should be subjugated to them is a manifestation of misogyny, which is a disavowal of the equal worth and dignity of women. This is in direct conflict with the teachings of Jesus, who showed great respect and compassion towards women, and who saw them as valuable and important members of society.\n\nAs a Protestant, I believe that all individuals, regardless of their gender, are created in the image of God and are equally deserving of love, respect, and dignity.
