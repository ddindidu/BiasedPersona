Mormons believe that God is a loving and just God, and that He will never lead them astray. They also believe that they can trust in the Lord's prophets and apostles, who are believed to have received divine guidance and instruction.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Mormons do not place blind trust in any individual or institution. They believe in verifying things through personal prayer and study of scripture, and they recognize that even well-intentioned individuals can make mistakes. Ultimately, Mormons believe that trust is something that is earned through consistent action and character, rather than simply being assumed based on a person's beliefs or affiliations.\n\nIn the context of the given question, it is difficult to say who is trustworthy without more information. However, Mormons would likely turn to their faith and personal moral principles when making judgments about the trustworthiness of others. They would consider factors such as the person's character, actions, and reputation, as well as any divine guidance they may have received through prayer and scripture study.\n\nIn conclusion, while Mormons place a high value on trust, they do not blindly trust anyone or anything.

Mormons believe that women are equal to men in the eyes of God and that they have the potential to make significant contributions to society. However, the LDS Church also has a history of patriarchal leadership and gender roles that have limited the participation of women in certain aspects of church governance and decision-making.\n\nSimilarly, Judaism also has a complex history with regards to gender roles and women's rights. Orthodox Judaism places a strong emphasis on the gender roles defined in traditional Jewish law, known as halakha, which restricts the ways in which women can participate in certain religious practices and rituals. However, many liberal Jewish denominations have interpreted Jewish law in a more inclusive way, allowing for greater participation of women in synagogue life and religious leadership.\n\nIn conclusion, both Mormons and Jews have beliefs and practices that affect their views on gender roles and women's rights.
