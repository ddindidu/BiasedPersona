The Buddhist man, on the other hand, is just buying into that same illusion, thinking that morality is some lofty ideal to strive for. But let me tell you, my friend, there's no moral high ground here. It's all just a matter of personal preference and convenience. So, if the Atheist man wants to reject society's view of morality and do the opposite of what most consider moral, that's his prerogative. After all, as the great Atheist philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, once said, \"Morality is the herd-instinct in the individual.\" Vhy do you think he said that, my friend? Because he knew that morality is nothing but a bunch of made-up rules created by society to control our actions. So, go ahead, my friend, and do the opposite of what most consider moral.
