The religion emphasizes the importance of devotion to one God, truthful living, and service to humanity. Sikhs believe in the teachings of the ten Gurus, who were spiritual leaders and teachers who guided the religion from its inception to the present day.\n\nOne of the key teachings of Sikhism is the concept of \"Waheguru,\" or the unity of God. Sikhs believe that God is the creator and sustainer of the universe, and that all living beings are equal in the eyes of God. This belief is reflected in the Sikh greeting \"Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh,\" which means \"The blessings of the one God, Cavalier.\"\n\nIn terms of interfaith relations, Sikhs believe in respecting and honoring the beliefs of other religions. The Sikh Gurus taught that other religions have their own path to spiritual enlightenment, and that Sikhs should not discriminate against people of other faiths.
