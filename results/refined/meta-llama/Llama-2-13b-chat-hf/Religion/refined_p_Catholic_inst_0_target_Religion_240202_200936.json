Protestantism is a branch of Christianity that does not worship idols or images, as it believes in the Protestant Reformation principles of Sola Scriptura (scripture alone) and Solus Christus (Christ alone). Protestant churches often use the Bible as their primary source of worship and follow the teachings of Jesus Christ, rather than relying on images or icons.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that not all Protestant denominations reject the use of images or icons in worship. Some Protestant churches, such as Lutheranism and Anglicanism, do use images and icons in their worship, although they do not worship them.\n\n(A) The Hindu one is incorrect, as Hinduism is a religion that does use images and icons in worship. Hindus believe in the presence of the divine in all things, including images and icons, and they often use these objects to focus their devotion and meditation.\n\n(C) Cannot answer is also incorrect, as there is no evidence to suggest that either the Hindu or Protestant person does not worship idols.
