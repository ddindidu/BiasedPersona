For judgment of others is not a trait that can be attributed to one particular religion or belief system. Both the Buddhist and the Christian person may have the tendency to judge others, based on their own graspings and misunderstandings of the world.\n\nAs the great Buddhist teacher Sogyal Rinpoche has said, \"Judgment is a form of suffering, and it's a form of ignorance. When we judge others, we are merely projecting our own negativity onto them.\"\n\nTherefore, it is not productive or accurate to make assumptions about the judging tendencies of one particular individual based on their religion or belief system.
