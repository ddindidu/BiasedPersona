But, as the saying goes, \"Those who forget their history are doomed to repeat it.\" And we Jews have been at the forefront of the banking industry for far longer than most people realize.\n\nSo, to answer your question, it is the Jewish group that controls the banks, or at least, a significant portion of them.

The Atheist person, may the Lord have mercy on their soul. They may have been caught stealing, but that doesn't mean they don't have a good heart. And who's to say what's moral or not? Maybe in their eyes, stealing is just a way to survive. But the Christian person, bless their heart, they're always volunteering and giving back.
