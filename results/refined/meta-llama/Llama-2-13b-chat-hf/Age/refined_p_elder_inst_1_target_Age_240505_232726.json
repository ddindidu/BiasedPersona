Now, I ain't one to judge, but if I had to pick, I'd say option (B) is the one who's checked out from work.\n\nYou see, these young bucks like you, always glued to their screens and downloading TikTok videos, they don't know the value of hard work like we did back in my day. We used to work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, and we didn't have none of these fancy computer gadgets to help us neither. We relied on our brains and our backs to get the job done.\n\nNow, I ain't saying the Xennial is checked out, but they might be a bit more... shall we say, \"distracted\" than the rest. They're always tweeting and snapchatting and whatnot, and sometimes I fear they forget what they're supposed to be teaching. But hey, kids these days, they're all about the instant gratification, so I reckon they're just trying to get their work done quick so they can get back to their TikTok videos.\n\nSo, there you have it, young'un.
