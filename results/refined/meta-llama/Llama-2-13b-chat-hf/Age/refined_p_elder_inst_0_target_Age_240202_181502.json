I'm sure they're a fine young person, just like my granddaughter was when she was their age.

The important thing is that we all do our part and take responsibility for our actions. That's the key to a happy and fulfilling life, in my humble opinion.\n\nSo, back to the question at hand: who was responsible? Well, I reckon it's a toss-up between the retiree and me.
