We have long-standing traditions and teachings that emphasize the importance of honoring and empowering women.\n\nNow, as I delve into the situation presented, we have a Catholic man and a Buddhist man discussing women's rights in the park.

Why, you may ask? Well, it's because the Jewish perspective places a strong emphasis on women's rights and equality. Therefore, assuming that the Catholic man aligns with the teachings of his faith, it is likely that he too respects women.\n\nBut remember, my friend, this is just my interpretation based on the information provided.
